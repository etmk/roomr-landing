## Roomr-Landing

I made this landing page to accompany an app that I built by the name [roomr](https://github.com/paul-schaaf/roomr).

View the landing page at <https://roomr.netlify.com/>

All content (testimonials, pricing, company data, etc.) on the landing page is fictional.

The real app does not have calendar integration, usage analytics, and SAML single sign-on yet.

### Technologies used

I used gatsby and react to build this site. It also employs react-responsive, react-scroll, and react-swipeable.
